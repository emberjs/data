### Requesting Features or Deprecations

`ember-data` participates in the [RFC process (GitHub emberjs/rfcs)](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/).
Most changes to the public API including new features, changes in behavior, or deprecations require
community discussion and must go through this process.

While there is no guarantee that an RFC will be accepted, successful RFCs typically follow a pattern
of iteration while gathering requirements, addressing feedback, and consensus building. The best RFCs
are narrowly scoped with clear understanding of alternatives, drawbacks, and their effect on the community.

    Here are a few suggestions of **steps to take before drafting your RFC** to best make your RFC successful.
    Often this process will complete quickly, but when it does not, don't despair! Often the best ideas
    take the longest to bake.

1. Bring up your idea in the `#dev-ember-data` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS) or
   with individual [team members](https://emberjs.com/team/)
2. Reflect on any concerns, alternatives, or questions that arise from these discussions.
3. Continue to discuss the idea, giving time for everyone to digest and think about it.
4. Attend the weekly team meeting to discuss your idea
5. Open an [RFC issue](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AT-ember-data)
   to broaden and record the discussion if the idea needs more time for discussion and iteration.
   - label your issue with `T-ember-data` (or ask someone in `#dev-ember-data` to add the label if you lack the permission)
   - announce your issue in `#dev-ember-data` and anywhere else desired such as `#news-and-announcements` and `twitter`.
6. [Draft an RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs#what-the-process-is) and share it with those you have
   been discussing the ideas with.
7. Publish your RFC by opening a PR to [emberjs/rfcs/](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3AT-ember-data)
   - label your PR with `T-ember-data` (or ask someone in `#dev-ember-data` to add the label if you lack the permission)
   - announce your PR in `#dev-ember-data` and anywhere else desired such as `#news-and-announcements` and `twitter`.
8. Attend weekly team meetings to discuss the RFC, continue iterating on the RFC, and help shepherd it to completion.
9. Build a proof-of-concept. Sometimes this is best if it occurs alongside drafting the RFC, as it often informs
   the RFC design, known drawbacks, and alternatives. Often it will become incorporated in the final implementation.
10. If you are able, help land the work in a release! It is not required that you implement your own RFC but often
    this is the best way to ensure that accepted RFCs are implemented in a timely manner.
