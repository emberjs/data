# Become A Contributor

Anyone can contribute to EmberData. Contributing can be as simple as opening an issue or helping to track down the cause of one. Or as involved as contributing a fix, helping with routine maintenance, or implementing a big new feature.

In addition to holding discussions on individual [issues](https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues)
or [RFCs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/labels/T-ember-data), we coordinate work when needed in the `#dev-ember-data` channel on [Ember's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS).
