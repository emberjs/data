# Thank you for opening this issue!

Hopefully, this issue template will help you provide us with enough information to assist in resolving the issue.

If you haven't already browsed recent issues (or less recent issues if this is for a past release), please do
 so first to see if your issue already has a ticket created for it. It is usually best to first ask about the
 issue you are observing in the `#ember-data` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS), doing so may
 help you discover existing issues or provide a clearer reproduction.

### Reproduction

Please provide one of the following:

- a PR linking to this issue with a failing test showing the issue
- a [Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/) with a simplified reproduction and instructions for how to
  observe the unexpected result.
- a github repository with a simplified reproduction and instructions for how to observe the unexpected result

### Description

Describe the issue in a few sentences, include both the *expected* result and the observed *unexpected* result.
If a previous version of `ember-data` worked as `expected`, which was the most recent version that worked?

```cli

*P.S. If any of the packages show more than one installed version, that may be the root cause of the issue!*
