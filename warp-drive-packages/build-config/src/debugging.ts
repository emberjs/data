/**
 * # Log Instrumentation <Badge type="tip" text="debug only" />
 *
 * Many portions of the internals are helpfully instrumented with logging.
 * This instrumentation is always removed from production builds.
 *
 * Log instrumentation is "regionalized" to specific concepts and concerns
 * to enable you to enable/disable just the areas you are interested in.
 *
 * To activate a particular group of logs set the appropriate flag to `true`
 * either in your build config or via the runtime helper.
 *
 *
 * ## Runtime Activation
 *
 * ::: tip ðŸ’¡ Just Works in browser Dev Tools!
 * No import is needed, and the logging config is preserved when the page is refreshed
 * :::
 *
 * ```ts
 * setWarpDriveLogging({
 *   LOG_CACHE: true,
 *   LOG_REQUESTS: true,
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * A runtime helper is attached to `globalThis` to enable activation of the logs
 * from anywhere in your application including from the devtools panel.
 *
 * The runtime helper overrides any build config settings for the given flag
 * for the current browser tab. It stores the configuration you give it in
 * `sessionStorage` so that it persists across page reloads of the current tab,
 * but not across browser tabs or windows.
 *
 * If you need to deactivate the logging, you can call the helper again with the
 * same flag set to `false` or just open a new tab/window.
 *
 * ## Buildtime Activation
 *
 * ```ts
 * setConfig(__dirname, app, {
 *   debug: {
 *     LOG_CACHE: true,
 *     LOG_REQUESTS: false,
 *     LOG_NOTIFICATIONS: true,
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The build config settings are used to set the default values for the
 * logging flags. Any logging flag that is not set in the build config
 * will default to `false`.
