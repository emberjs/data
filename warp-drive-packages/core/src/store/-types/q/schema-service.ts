/**
 * The SchemaService provides the ability to query for information about the structure
 * of any resource type.
 *
 * Applications can provide any implementation of the SchemaService they please so long
 * as it conforms to this interface.
 *
 * The design of the service means that schema information could be lazily populated,
 * derived-on-demand, or progressively enhanced during the course of an application's runtime.
 * The primary requirement is merely that any information the service needs to correctly
 * respond to an inquest is available by the time it is asked.
 *
 * The `@ember-data/model` package provides an implementation of this service which
 * makes use of your model classes as the source of information to respond to queries
 * about resource schema. While this is useful, this may not be ideal for your application.
 * For instance, Schema information could be sideloaded or pre-flighted for API calls,
 * resulting in no need to bundle and ship potentially large and expensive JSON
 * or large Javascript based Models to pull information from.
 *
 * To register a custom schema implementation, implement the store's `createSchemaService`
 * hook to return an instance of your service.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Store from '@ember-data/store';
 * import CustomSchemas from './custom-schemas';
 *
 * export default class extends Store {
 *   createSchemaService() {
 *     return new CustomSchemas();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * At runtime, both the `Store` and the `CacheCapabilitiesManager` provide
 * access to this service via the `schema` property.
 *
 * ```ts
 * export default class extends Component {
 *  @service store;
 *
 *  get fields() {
 *    return this.store
 *      .schema
 *      .fields(this.args.dataType);
 *  }
 * }

   * Traits are re-usable collections of fields that can be composed to

   *
   * When we finalize a resource, we walk its traits and apply their fields
   * to the resource's fields. All specified traits must be registered by
   * this time or an error will be thrown.
   *
   * Traits are applied left-to-right, with traits of traits being applied in the same
   * way. Thus for the most part, application of traits is a post-order graph traversal
   * problem.
   *
   * A trait is only ever processed once. If multiple traits (A, B, C) have the same
   * trait (D) as a dependency, D will be included only once when first encountered by
   * A.
   *
   * If a cycle exists such that trait A has trait B which has Trait A, trait A will
   * be applied *after* trait B in production. In development a cycle error will be thrown.
   *
   * Fields are finalized on a "last wins principle". Thus traits appearing higher in
   * the tree and further to the right of a traits array take precedence, with the
   * resource's fields always being applied last and winning out.

   * is an object with at least the following properties:
   *
   * - `name` which should also match the `key` used in the dictionary.

   * - `type` which should be the related resource's string "type"
   * - `options` which should be a dictionary allowing any key but with

   * - `options.async` a boolean representing whether data for this relationship is
   *      typically loaded on-demand.
   * - `options.inverse` a string or null representing the field name / key of the
   *       corresponding relationship on the inverse resource.
   *
   * Additionally the following options properties are optional. See [Polymorphic Relationships](https://rfcs.emberjs.com/id/0793-polymporphic-relations-without-inheritance)
   *
   * - `options.polymorphic` a boolean representing whether multiple resource types
   *    can be used to satisfy this relationship.
   * - `options.as` a string representing the abstract type that the concrete side of
   *    a relationship must specify when fulfilling a polymorphic inverse.
   *
   * For example, the following Model using @ember-data/model would generate this relationships
   * definition by default:
   *
   * ```js
   * class User extends Model {
   *   @belongsTo('user', { async: false, inverse: null }) bestFriend;
