/**
 * Many parts of EmberData are interface-driven,
 * meaning that no specific base-class is necessary
 * to implement an interopable module of your own
 * utilizing only public APIs.
 *
 * Examples of primitives in EmberData that are interface-driven
 * include Adapters, Serializers, Request Handlers, and the Cache.
 *
 * These **Not Yet Installable** Typescript Types
 * Document key interfaces that libraries and
 * applications interfacing with EmberData would need
 * to conform to.
