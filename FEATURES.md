## About Features

Please read the [Feature Flag Guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/configuring-ember/feature-flags/)
for a detailed explanation.

To add a new feature flag or change an existing one, you can add an
entry in `config/features.json`.

**Ember Data features flags must begin with `ds-`, such as
`ds-new-coalescing`.**
