# Release

The EmberData release process has a few manual steps.

The following steps navigate us through some of the release gotchas and will
hopefully result in a successful release.

There are four release channels, `lts`, `release`, `beta` and `canary`.
Each has it's own section below.

In this guide, we are assuming that the remote `origin` is `git@github.com:emberjs/data.git`,
this remote needs to exist and `origin/main` `origin/beta` `origin/release` etc. need to be the upstreams of the local `main` `beta` `release` branches etc.

## Before We Start

Before we begin the release train, make sure that the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) is properly
updated on `main` and `beta` so that it will be accurate when the new release branch is
created. To do this you likely need to reach out to EmberData core team members to ensure
all recent planning discussions and work is properly accounted for.

## Getting Setup To Do A Release

In order to release `ember-data` you must first ensure the following things:

- You have `commit` rights to `ember-data` on GitHub
- You have an account on `npm` and belongs to the `ember-data` organization on NPM
- You have `publish` rights within the `ember-data` organization on NPM
- You have configured your NPM account to use `2fa` (two factor authentication)
- You have logged into your NPM account on your machine (typically sessions preserve nearly forever once you have)
- You have configured `GITHUB_AUTH` token for `lerna-changelog` to be able to gather info for the release notes.
- You have installed `bun`, `pnpm` and `node` globally (or better, via `volta`)

## Release Order

When releasing more than one channel, we release from "most stable" to "least stable"

- `lts` (_Most Stable_)
- `release`
- `beta`
- `canary` (_Least Stable_)

## Announce release!

Once you have finished this release process, we recommend posting an announcement to
Twitter the Crosslinking the announcement to the following Discord channels.

### LTS Release

1. Checkout the correct branch

   a. For the first release of a new `LTS`, create a new branch from `origin/release`

   DO THIS PRIOR TO PUBLISHING THE NEXT RELEASE

   ```
   git fetch origin;
   git checkout -b lts-<majorVersion>-<minorVersion> origin/release;
   ```

   b. For subsequent releases of this `LTS`, ensure your local branch is in-sync with the remote.

   ```
   git fetch origin;
   git checkout lts-<majorVersion>-<minorVersion>;
   git reset --hard origin/lts-<majorVersion>-<minorVersion>;
   ```

2. Generate the Changelog

> Note: If this is the first release of the LTS and there are no changes, just add an entry for the next patch version stating we are promoting the release to LTS.

The Changelog is generated with [lerna-changelog](https://github.com/lerna/lerna-changelog).

The changelog is generated based on labels applied to PRs since the last release. These labels are configured in the root `package.json`. Before merging PRs reviewers should always ensure a meaningful title for the changelog exists.

For the first release of an LTS, `previous-version` will be the last released version of the `release` channel: e.g. `v4.8.1`

For subsequent versions it will be whatever version number we previously published for this LTS.

To actually generate the changelog, run:

```
pnpm exec lerna-changelog --from=PREVIOUS_VERSION_TAG
```

Note: if it is the first time that you use lerna-changelog, you might have to add a token to fetch from Github API:
https://github.com/lerna/lerna-changelog#github-token

Then:

- insert lerna-changelog output to `CHANGELOG.md` underneath the document title
- commit the changelog and push the change upstream:

```
git add CHANGELOG.md;
git commit -m "Update Changelog for v<new-lts-version>"
git push origin lts-<majorVersion>-<minorVersion> // Note: alternatively, you can make a PR to lts-<majorVersion>-<minorVersion> to make sure there are no errors
```

3. Publish the LTS

   ```
   bun run publish lts
   ```

4. Update the Release Notes on Github

- Visit [Ember Data Releases](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases)
  - Click on the "Tags"
  - Click on the tag just published
  - Edit the tag, adding a meaningful title and attaching the changelog (see other releases for examples)
  - Publish the release!

### Latest / Stable Release

1. Checkout the `release` branch and ensure it is in-sync with `origin/release`.

   DO NOT WORK FROM A LOCAL `release` branch THAT DIFFERS

   a. If this is the first `release` release of the cycle, we "cut" from `beta`.

   DO THIS PRIOR TO PUBLISHING THE NEXT BETA

   ```
   git checkout release;
   git fetch origin;
   git reset --hard origin/beta;
   git push origin release -f;
   ```

   b. For subsequent `release` releases during the cycle, we release from the `release` branch.

   ```
   git checkout release;
   git fetch origin;
   git reset --hard origin/release;
   ```

2. Generate the Changelog

   IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL CHANGES ARE ON THE REMOTE BRANCH SPECIFIED BY HEAD

   `previous-version` will be whatever version we previously published as a `release`. E.g. if our last release was `4.8.4` and now we are publishing `4.9.0` then we would use `--from=v4.8.4`

   ```
   pnpm exec lerna-changelog --from=PREVIOUS_VERSION_TAG
   ```

- prepend a new section title for this version with Today's date to `CHANGELOG.md`
- insert changelog script output to `CHANGELOG.md` underneath this new section title
- edit changelog output to be as user-friendly as possible (drop [INTERNAL] changes, non-code changes, etc.)
- commit the changelog and push the change upstream

  ```
  git add CHANGELOG.md;
  git commit -m "Update Changelog for v<new-version>";
  git push origin release;
  ```

5. Publish the release

   ```
   bun run publish release
   ```

6. Update the Release Notes on Github

- Visit [Ember Data Releases](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases)
  - Click on the "more recent tags"
  - Click on the tag just published
  - Edit the tag, adding a meaningful title and attaching the changelog (see other releases for examples)
  - Publish the release!

### Manual Beta Releases

> Note: Most Beta Releases should be handled by the `Canary-Mirror-Beta Release` workflow, which should be manually triggered from the actions page.

1. Checkout the `#beta` branch and ensure it is in-sync with `origin/beta`.

   DO NOT WORK FROM A LOCAL `beta` branch THAT DIFFERS

   a. If this is the first `beta` release of the cycle, we "cut" from `#main`.

   DO THIS PRIOR TO PUBLISHING THE NEXT CANARY

   ```
   git checkout beta;
   git fetch origin;
   git reset --hard origin/main;
   git push origin beta -f;
   ```

   b. For subsequent `beta` releases during the cycle, we release from the beta branch.

   ```
   git checkout beta;
   git fetch origin;
   git reset --hard origin/beta;
   ```

2. Publish the weekly beta

   ```
   bun run publish beta
   ```

### Canary Releases

1. Checkout the `#main` branch and ensure it is in-sync with `origin/main`.

   DO NOT WORK FROM A LOCAL `main` branch THAT DIFFERS

   ```js
   git checkout main;
   git fetch origin;
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

2. Publish the nightly.

   a. If this is the very first `canary` release for a new minor

   ```
   bun run publish canary -i minor
   ```

   b. If this is the very first `canary` release for a new major

   ```
   bun run publish canary -i major
   ```

   c. For all other "nightly" canary releases

   ```
   bun run publish canary
   ```

Congrats, you are finished!

#### Canary Auto Publish

New canary versions are published to npm every Tuesday and Friday at 12pm PST by the `Alpha Release` GitHub action. They can also be published using the workflow trigger.

It will always increment the pre-release version of what's currently in the root `package.json`. For example from `3.25.0-alpha.1` to `3.25.0-alpha.2`. **It requires a human to manually bump minor and major versions and publish**.

To try out the script that will be executed in the GitHub action, use:
`bun run publish canary --dry_run --dangerously_force`. The `--dry_run` param will skip auto committing the version change and publishing.
