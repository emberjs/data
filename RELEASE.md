Release
=======

Although not very tricky, the Ember Data release process does have a
lot of manual steps. The following steps navigate us through
some of the release gotchas and will hopefully result in a successful
release.

STEPS:
------

* generate changelog (`PRIOR_VERSION=v2.0.0 HEAD=release ./bin/changelog`)
* prepend changelog output to `CHANGELOG.md`
* edit changelog output to be as user-friendly as possible (drop [INTERNAL] changes, non-code changes, etc.)
  * If this is the release branch  make sure to pr the changelog to the master branch and cherry pick it to the release branch.
  * If this is the beta branch the changelogs do not need to be pred to the master branch as master will be updated when the beta goes to release.
* Bump version in package.json
  * `git add package.json`
  * `git commit -m "Release Ember Data X.Y.Z-beta.n"`
* Git tag version
  * `git tag vX.Y.Z-beta.n`
* Do a production build. 
  * `rm -rf node_modules; yarn install; npm run build:production`
* Publish to NPM
  * `npm publish` or `npm publish --tag beta` or `npm publish --tag release-1-13`
* Update the `/builds/` page on the website
  * `cd ../website`
  * Edit [lastRelease, futureVersion and date](https://github.com/emberjs/website/blob/master/source/javascripts/app/builds/app.js#L238-L241) values for the release channel we are releasing.
  * Commit updated `javascripts/app/builds/app.js` file
  * `rake deploy`
* Write a Release Blog Post (Does not happen for beta releases)
  * Commits since last release: `git log --oneline release..beta | wc -l`.
  * Contributors since last release: `git shortlog -s -n release...beta | wc -l`
* Submit a Pull request to the https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli to update the version of Ember Data
  * (per request by @rwjblue and is also a great idea to make upgrading/new apps easier)
* Bump version in package.json back to a canary version
* For beta.1 releases, branch beta from master and update https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/master/config/features.json to have `false` values instead of `null` and update the version in package.json


Tag the release

1. Under `Releases` on GitHub choose `Draft New Release`
* enter the new version number as the tag prefixed with `v` e.g. (`v0.1.12`)
* for release title choose a great name, no pressure
* in the description paste the changelog items for this release only
* click pre-release for beta releases
* publish the release

Announce release!

1. on Twitter
* then crosslink Twitter post on slack #dev-ember-data and #ember-data
