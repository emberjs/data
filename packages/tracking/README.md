Tracking Primitives for controlling change notification of Tracked properties when working with EmberData

> Note: This is a V2 Addon, but we have intentionally configured it to act and report as a V1 Addon due
to bugs with ember-auto-import.
>
> We can remove the V1 tag if ember-auto-import will no longer attempt
to load V2 addons or if it is fixed to work with V1 addons with custom addon trees and also dedupes modules for test apps.
> 
> You can still consume this as a normal library.
> In other projects.
