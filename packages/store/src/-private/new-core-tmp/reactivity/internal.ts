/**
 * A WarpDriveSignal is a wrapper around a framework specific or TC39 signal
 * that enables us to store and manage the signal in a universal way.
 *
 * WarpDrive uses signals to manage three separate concepts:
 *
 * - as a `storage` for a value local to the object that we want to be reactive
 *   (see `@local` schema field for an example)
 * - as a `gate` for a memoized getter that we want to act as a reactive property
 *   but whose value is computed/pulled from a non-reactive source elsewhere
 *   and whose latest value is stored in the signal
 *   (see `field` schema field for an example)
 * - as a `gate` with a manually managed value updated on pull when `isStale` is true
 *
 *
 * It offers
 *
 * - a non-reactive way to access/update the current value
 * - a non-reactive way to mark the signal as dirtied
 * - a non-reactive way to store content for why the signal was dirtied
 * - access to the underlying Signal(s) in-use
 *
 * For debugging:
 * - the "key" or "name" of the signal
 * - the "object identity" or "context" to which the signal is attached
 *
