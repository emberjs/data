/**
 * ## Deprecation Management
 *
 * EmberData allows users to opt-in and remove code that exists to support deprecated
 * behaviors.
 *
 * If your app has resolved all deprecations present in a given version,
 * you may specify that version as your "compatibility" version to remove
 * the code that supported the deprecated behavior from your app.
 *
 * For instance, if a deprecation was introduced in 3.13, and the app specifies
 * 3.13 as its minimum version compatibility, any deprecations introduced before
 * or during 3.13 would be stripped away.
 *
 * An app can use a different version than what it specifies as it's compatibility
 * version. For instance, an App could be using `3.16` while specifying compatibility
 * with `3.12`. This would remove any deprecations that were present in or before `3.12`
 * but keep support for anything deprecated in or above `3.13`.
 *
 * You may also specify that specific deprecations are resolved. These approaches
 * may be used together.
 *
 * ```ts
 * setConfig(app, __dirname, {
 *   // declare that all deprecations through "5.0" have been fully resolved
 *   compatWith: '5.0',
 *
 *   // mark individual deprecations as resolved by setting them to `false`
 *   deprecations: {
 *     // resolve individual deprecations here
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * > [!TIP]
 * > EmberData does not test against permutations of deprecations
 * > being stripped, our tests run against "all deprecated code included"
 * > and "all deprecated code removed". Unspecified behavior may sometimes occur
 * > when removing code for only some deprecations associated to a version number.

 * **id: ember-data:deprecate-promise-many-array-behavior**
 *
 * [RFC Documentation](https://rfcs.emberjs.com/id/0745-ember-data-deprecate-methods-on-promise-many-array)
 *
 * This deprecation deprecates accessing values on the asynchronous proxy
 * in favor of first "resolving" or "awaiting" the promise to retrieve a
 * synchronous value.
 *
 * Template iteration of the asynchronous value will still work and not trigger
 * the deprecation, but all JS access should be avoided and HBS access for anything
 * but `{{#each}}` should also be refactored.
 *
 * Recommended approaches include using the addon `ember-promise-helpers`, using
 * Ember's `resource` pattern (including potentially the addon `ember-data-resources`),
 * resolving the value in routes/provider components, or using the references API.
 *
 * An example of using the [hasMany](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/4.11/classes/Model/methods/hasMany?anchor=hasMany) [reference API](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/HasManyReference):

 * const value = person.hasMany('friends').value();
 *
 * // to get just the list of related IDs
 * const ids = person.hasMany('friends').ids();

 * References participate in autotracking and getters/cached getters etc. which consume them
 * will recompute if the value changes.

/**
 * **id: ember-data:deprecate-relationship-remote-update-clearing-local-state**
 *
 * Deprecates when a relationship is updated remotely and the local state
 * is cleared of all changes except for "new" records.
 *
 * Instead, any records not present in the new payload will be considered
 * "removed" while any records present in the new payload will be considered "added".
 *
 * This allows us to "commit" local additions and removals, preserving any additions
 * or removals that are not yet reflected in the remote state.
 *
 * For instance, given the following initial state:
 *
 * remote: A, B, C
 * local: add D, E
 *        remove B, C
 * => A, D, E
 *
 *
 * If after an update, the remote state is now A, B, D, F then the new state will be
 *
 * remote: A, B, D, F
 * local: add E
 *        remove B
 * => A, D, E, F
 *
 * Under the old behavior the updated local state would instead have been
 * => A, B, D, F
 *
 * Similarly, if a belongsTo remote State was A while its local state was B,
 * then under the old behavior if the remote state changed to C, the local state
 * would be updated to C. Under the new behavior, the local state would remain B.
 *
 * If the remote state was A while its local state was `null`, then under the old
 * behavior if the remote state changed to C, the local state would be updated to C.
 * Under the new behavior, the local state would remain `null`.
 *
 * Thus the new correct mental model is that the state of the relationship at any point
 * in time is whatever the most recent remote state is, plus any local additions or removals
 * you have made that have not yet been reflected by the remote state.
 *
 * > Note: The old behavior extended to modifying the inverse of a relationship. So if
 * > you had local state not reflected in the new remote state, inverses would be notified
 * > and their state reverted as well when "resetting" the relationship.
 * > Under the new behavior, since the local state is preserved the inverses will also
 * > not be reverted.
 *
 * ### Resolving this deprecation
 *
 * Resolving this deprecation can be done individually for each relationship
 * or globally for all relationships.
 *

 * to `false` in ember-cli-build.js

 *   deprecations: {
 *     // set to false to strip the deprecated code (thereby opting into the new behavior)
 *     DEPRECATE_RELATIONSHIP_REMOTE_UPDATE_CLEARING_LOCAL_STATE: false
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To resolve this deprecation on an individual relationship, adjust the `options` passed to
 * the relationship. For relationships with inverses, both sides MUST be migrated to the new
 * behavior at the same time.
 *
 * ```js
 * class Person extends Model {
 *  @hasMany('person', {
 *    async: false,
 *    inverse: null,
 *    resetOnRemoteUpdate: false
 *  }) children;
 *
 *  @belongsTo('person', {
 *    async: false,
 *    inverse: null,
 *    resetOnRemoteUpdate: false
 *  }) parent;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * > Note: false is the only valid value here, all other values (including missing)
 * > will be treated as true, where `true` is the legacy behavior that is now deprecated.
 *
 * Once you have migrated all relationships, you can remove the the resetOnRemoteUpdate
 * option and set the deprecation flag to false in ember-cli-build.
 *
 * ### What if I don't want the new behavior?
 *
 * EmberData's philosophy is to not make assumptions about your application. Where possible
 * we seek out "100%" solutions – solutions that work for all use cases - and where that is
 * not possible we default to "90%" solutions – solutions that work for the vast majority of use
 * cases. In the case of "90%" solutions we look for primitives that allow you to resolve the
 * 10% case in your application. If no such primitives exist, we provide an escape hatch that
 * ensures you can build the behavior you need without adopting the cost of the default solution.
 *
 * In this case, the old behavior was a "40%" solution. The inability for an application developer
 * to determine what changes were made locally, and thus what changes should be preserved, made
 * it impossible to build certain features easily, or in some cases at all. The proliferation of
 * feature requests, bug reports (from folks surprised by the prior behavior) and addon attempts
 * in this space are all evidence of this.
 *
 * We believe the new behavior is a "90%" solution. It works for the vast majority of use cases,
 * often without noticeable changes to existing application behavior, and provides primitives that
 * allow you to build the behavior you need for the remaining 10%.
 *
 * The great news is that this behavior defaults to trusting your API similar to the old behavior.
 * If your API is correct, you will not need to make any changes to your application to adopt
 * the new behavior.
 *
 * This means the 10% cases are those where you can't trust your API to provide the correct
 * information. In these cases, because you now have cheap access to a diff of the relationship
 * state, there are a few options that weren't available before:
 *
 * - you can adjust returned API payloads to contain the expected changes that it doesn't include
 * - you can modify local state by adding or removing records on the HasMany record array to remove
 *   any local changes that were not returned by the API.
 * - you can use `<Cache>.mutate(mutation)` to directly modify the local cache state of the relationship
 *   to match the expected state.
 *
 * What this version (5.3) does not yet provide is a way to directly modify the cache's remote state
 * for the relationship via public APIs other than via the broader action of upserting a response via
 * `<Cache>.put(document)`. However, such an API was sketched in the Cache 2.1 RFC
 * `<Cache>.patch(operation)` and is likely to be added in a future 5.x release of EmberData.
 *
 * This version (5.3) also does not yet provide a way to directly modify the graph (a general purpose
 * subset of cache behaviors specific to relationships) via public APIs. However, during the
 * 5.x release series we will be working on finalizing the Graph API and making it public.
 *
 * If none of these options work for you, you can always opt-out more broadly by implementing
 * a custom Cache with the relationship behaviors you need.
