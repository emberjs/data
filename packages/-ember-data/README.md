> EmberData is going universal and rebranding as WarpDrive
> with support for any signals based reactive framework!

## Basic Installation

Install using your javascript package manager of choice. For instance with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

```no-highlight
pnpm add ember-data
```

`ember-data` is installed by default for new applications generated with `ember-cli`. You can check what version is installed by looking in the `devDependencies` hash of your project's [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json) file.

If you have generated a new `Ember` application using `ember-cli` but do
not wish to use `ember-data`, remove `ember-data` from your project's `package.json` file and run your package manager's install command to update your lockfile.

## Advanced Installation

*Ember***Data** is organized into primitives that compose together via public APIs. These primitives are organized into
small packages encapsulating these boundaries. These packages
declare peer-dependencies (sometimes optional peer dependencies)
on the other *Ember***Data**/*Warp***Drive** packages they require use of.

- [@ember-data/request](../packages/request) provides managed `fetch`
- [@ember-data/request-utils](../packages/request-utils) provides optional utilities for managing requests and string manipulation
- [@ember-data/store](../packages/store) provides core functionality around coordinating caching and reactivity 
- [@ember-data/tracking](../packages/tracking) enables integration with Ember's reactivity system
- [@ember-data/json-api](../packages/json-api) provides a cache for data in the [{JSON:API}](https://jsonapi.org) format.
- [@ember-data/debug](../packages/debug) provides (optional) debugging support for the `ember-inspector`.
- [@warp-drive/build-config](../packages/build-config) provides a build plugin which ensures proper settings configuration for deprecations, optional features, development/testing support and debug logging.
- [@warp-drive/core-types](../packages/core-types) provides core types and symbols used by all other packages
- [@warp-drive/schema-record](../packages/schema-record) provides a flexible, schema-based approach to reactive data.
- [@warp-drive/ember](../packages/ember) provides Ember specific components and utilities for reactive control-flow and declarative state management.

Some EmberData APIs are older than others, and these still interop via well-defined
 public API boundaries but are no longer the ideal approach.

- [@ember-data/model](../packages/model) provides a class-based approach to declaring schemas for reactive data.
- [@ember-data/legacy-compat](../packages/legacy-compat) provides support for the older adapter/serializer request paradigm that is being phased out
- [@ember-data/adapter](../packages/adapter) provides various network API integrations for APIs built over specific REST or `{JSON:API}` conventions.
- [@ember-data/serializer](../packages/serializer) provides an approach to normalizing and serializing data to and from an API format into the `{JSON:API}` format.

And finally:

- [ember-data](./packages/-ember-data) is a "meta" package which bundles many of these together for convenience in a "legacy" configuration.
