/**
  Normally, applications will use the `RESTSerializer` by implementing
  the `normalize` method and individual normalizations under
  `normalizeHash`.

  This allows you to do whatever kind of munging you need, and is
  especially useful if your server is inconsistent and you need to
  do munging differently for many different kinds of responses.

  See the `normalize` documentation for more information.

  ## Across the Board Normalization

  There are also a number of hooks that you might find useful to defined
  across-the-board rules for your payload. These rules will be useful
  if your server is consistent, or if you're building an adapter for
  an infrastructure service, like Parse, and want to encode service
  conventions.

  For example, if all of your keys are underscored and all-caps, but
  otherwise consistent with the names you use in your models, you
  can implement across-the-board rules for how to convert an attribute
  name in your model to a key in your JSON.

  ```js
  App.ApplicationSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({
    keyForAttribute: function(attr) {
      return Ember.String.underscore(attr).toUpperCase();
    }
  });
  ```

  You can also implement `keyForRelationship`, which takes the name
  of the relationship as the first parameter, and the kind of
  relationship (`hasMany` or `belongsTo`) as the second parameter.

  @class RESTSerializer
  @namespace DS
  @extends DS.JSONSerializer
*/
DS.RESTSerializer = DS.JSONSerializer.extend({
  /**
    Normalizes a part of the JSON payload returned by
    the server. You should override this method, munge the hash
    and call super if you have generic normalization to do.

    It takes the type of the record that is being normalized
    (as a DS.Model class), the property where the hash was
    originally found, and the hash to normalize.

    For example, if you have a payload that looks like this:

    ```js
    {
      "post": {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Rails is omakase",
        "comments": [ 1, 2 ]
      },
      "comments": [{
        "id": 1,
        "body": "FIRST"
      }, {
        "id": 2,
        "body": "Rails is unagi"
      }]
    }
    ```

    The `normalize` method will be called three times:

    * With `App.Post`, `"posts"` and `{ id: 1, title: "Rails is omakase", ... }`
    * With `App.Comment`, `"comments"` and `{ id: 1, body: "FIRST" }`
    * With `App.Comment`, `"comments"` and `{ id: 2, body: "Rails is unagi" }`

    You can use this method, for example, to normalize underscored keys to camelized
    or other general-purpose normalizations.

    If you want to do normalizations specific to some part of the payload, you
    can specify those under `normalizeHash`.

    For example, if the `IDs` under `"comments"` are provided as `_id` instead of
    `id`, you can specify how to normalize just the comments:

    ```js
    App.PostSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({
      normalizeHash: {
        comments: function(hash) {
          hash.id = hash._id;
          delete hash._id;
          return hash;
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    The key under `normalizeHash` is just the original key that was in the original
    payload.

    a single record, such as in response to a `find` or `save`.

    It is your opportunity to clean up the server's response into the normalized
    form expected by Ember Data.

    If you want, you can just restructure the top-level of your payload, and
    do more fine-grained normalization in the `normalize` method.

    For example, if you have a payload like this in response to a request for
    post 1:

    ```js
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Rails is omakase",

      "_embedded": {

          "comment_title": "Rails is unagi"
        }]
      }
    }
    ```

    You could implement a serializer that looks like this to get your payload
    into shape:

    ```js
    App.PostSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({
      // First, restructure the top-level so it's organized by type
      extractSingle: function(store, type, payload, id, requestType) {
        var comments = payload._embedded.comment;
        delete payload._embedded;

        payload = { comments: comments, post: payload };
        return this._super(store, type, payload, id, requestType);
      },

      normalizeHash: {
        // Next, normalize individual comments, which (after `extract`)
        // are now located under `comments`
        comments: function(hash) {
          hash.id = hash._id;
          hash.title = hash.comment_title;
          delete hash._id;
          delete hash.comment_title;
          return hash;
        }
      }
    })
    ```

    When you call super from your own implementation of `extractSingle`, the
    built-in implementation will find the primary record in your normalized
    payload and push the remaining records into the store.

    The primary record is the single hash found under `post` or the first
    element of the `posts` array.

    The primary record has special meaning when the record is being created
    for the first time or updated (`createRecord` or `updateRecord`). In
    particular, it will update the properties of the record that was saved.

  // SERIALIZE

  /**
    Called when a record is saved in order to convert the
    record into JSON.

    By default, it creates a JSON object with a key for
    each attribute and belongsTo relationship.

    For example, consider this model:

    ```js
    App.Comment = DS.Model.extend({
      title: DS.attr(),
      body: DS.attr(),

      author: DS.belongsTo('user')
    });
    ```

    The default serialization would create a JSON object like:

    ```js
    {
      "title": "Rails is unagi",
      "body": "Rails? Omakase? O_O",
      "author": 12
    }
    ```

    By default, attributes are passed through as-is, unless
    you specified an attribute type (`DS.attr('date')`). If
    you specify a transform, the JavaScript value will be
    serialized when inserted into the JSON hash.

    By default, belongs-to relationships are converted into
    IDs when inserted into the JSON hash.

    ## IDs

    `serialize` takes an options hash with a single option:
    `includeId`. If this option is `true`, `serialize` will,
    by default include the ID in the JSON object it builds.

    The adapter passes in `includeId: true` when serializing
    a record for `createRecord`, but not for `updateRecord`.

    ## Customization

    Your server may expect a different JSON format than the
    built-in serialization format.

    In that case, you can implement `serialize` yourself and
    return a JSON hash of your choosing.

    ```js
    App.PostSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({
      serialize: function(post, options) {
        var json = {
          POST_TTL: post.get('title'),
          POST_BDY: post.get('body'),
          POST_CMS: post.get('comments').mapProperty('id')
        }

        if (options.includeId) {
          json.POST_ID_ = post.get('id');
        }

        return json;
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Customizing an App-Wide Serializer

    If you want to define a serializer for your entire
    application, you'll probably want to use `eachAttribute`
    and `eachRelationship` on the record.

    ```js
    App.ApplicationSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({
      serialize: function(record, options) {
        var json = {};

        record.eachAttribute(function(name) {
          json[serverAttributeName(name)] = record.get(name);
        })

        record.eachRelationship(function(name, relationship) {
          if (relationship.kind === 'hasMany') {
            json[serverHasManyName(name)] = record.get(name).mapBy('id');
          }
        });

        if (options.includeId) {
          json.ID_ = record.get('id');
        }

        return json;
      }
    });

    function serverAttributeName(attribute) {
      return attribute.underscore().toUpperCase();
    }

    function serverHasManyName(name) {
      return serverAttributeName(name.singularize()) + "_IDS";
    }
    ```

    This serializer will generate JSON that looks like this:

    ```js
    {
      "TITLE": "Rails is omakase",
      "BODY": "Yep. Omakase.",
      "COMMENT_IDS": [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    }
    ```

    ## Tweaking the Default JSON

    If you just want to do some small tweaks on the default JSON,
    you can call super first and make the tweaks on the returned
    JSON.

    ```js
    App.PostSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({
      serialize: function(record, options) {
        var json = this._super(record, options);

        json.subject = json.title;
        delete json.title;

        return json;
      }
    });
    ```

    @method serialize
    @param record
    @param options
  */
  serialize: function(record, options) {
    return this._super.apply(this, arguments);
  },

  serializeIntoHash: function(hash, type, record, options) {
    hash[type.typeKey] = this.serialize(record, options);
  },

  /**
    You can use this method to customize how polymorphic objects are serialized.
    By default the JSON Serializer creates the key by appending `_type` to
    the attribute and value from the model's camelcased model name.

    @method serializePolymorphicType
    @param {DS.Model} record
    @param {Object} json
    @param relationship
  */
  serializePolymorphicType: function(record, json, relationship) {
    var key = relationship.key,
        belongsTo = get(record, key);
    key = this.keyForAttribute ? this.keyForAttribute(key) : key;
    json[key + "_type"] = belongsTo.constructor.typeKey;
  }
});
