  `DS.Serializer` is an abstract base class that you should override in your
  application to customize it for your backend. The minimum set of methods
  that you should implement is:

    * `extract()`
    * `serialize()`

  And you can optionally override the following methods:

    * `normalize()`

  For an example implementation, see
  [DS.JSONSerializer](DS.JSONSerializer.html), the included JSON serializer.
