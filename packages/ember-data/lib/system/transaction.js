/**
  A transaction allows you to collect multiple records into a unit of work
  that can be committed or rolled back as a group.

  For example, if a record has local modifications that have not yet
  been saved, calling `commit()` on its transaction will cause those
  modifications to be sent to the adapter to be saved. Calling
  `rollback()` on its transaction would cause all of the modifications to
  be discarded and the record to return to the last known state before
  changes were made.

  If a newly created record's transaction is rolled back, it will
  immediately transition to the deleted state.

  If you do not explicitly create a transaction, a record is assigned to
  an implicit transaction called the default transaction. In these cases,
  you can treat your application's instance of `DS.Store` as a transaction
  and call the `commit()` and `rollback()` methods on the store itself.

  Once a record has been successfully committed or rolled back, it will
  be moved back to the implicit transaction. Because it will now be in
  a clean state, it can be moved to a new transaction if you wish.

  ### Creating a Transaction

  To create a new transaction, call the `transaction()` method of your
  application's `DS.Store` instance:

      var transaction = App.store.transaction();

  This will return a new instance of `DS.Transaction` with no records
  yet assigned to it.

  ### Adding Existing Records

  Add records to a transaction using the `add()` method:

      record = App.store.find(App.Person, 1);
      transaction.add(record);

  Note that only records whose `isDirty` flag is `false` may be added
  to a transaction. Once modifications to a record have been made
  (its `isDirty` flag is `true`), it is not longer able to be added to
  a transaction.

  ### Creating New Records

  Because newly created records are dirty from the time they are created,
  and because dirty records can not be added to a transaction, you must
  use the `createRecord()` method to assign new records to a transaction.

  For example, instead of this:

    var transaction = store.transaction();
    var person = App.Person.createRecord({ name: "Steve" });

    // won't work because person is dirty
    transaction.add(person);

  Call `createRecord()` on the transaction directly:

    var transaction = store.transaction();
    transaction.createRecord(App.Person, { name: "Steve" });

  ### Asynchronous Commits

  Typically, all of the records in a transaction will be committed
  together. However, new records that have a dependency on other new
  records need to wait for their parent record to be saved and assigned an
  ID. In that case, the child record will continue to live in the
  transaction until its parent is saved, at which time the transaction will
  attempt to commit again.

  For this reason, you should not re-use transactions once you have committed
  them. Always make a new transaction and move the desired records to it before
  calling commit.
