/**
  The store contains all of the data for records loaded from the server.
  It is also responsible for creating instances of DS.Model that wrap
  the individual data for a record, so that they can be bound to in your
  Handlebars templates.

  Define your application's store like this:

       MyApp.Store = DS.Store.extend();

  Most Ember.js applications will only have a single `DS.Store` that is
  automatically created by their `Ember.Application`.

  You can retrieve models from the store in several ways. To retrieve a record
  for a specific id, use `DS.Model`'s `find()` method:

       var person = App.Person.find(123);

  If your application has multiple `DS.Store` instances (an unusual case), you can
  specify which store should be used:

      var person = store.find(App.Person, 123);

  In general, you should retrieve models using the methods on `DS.Model`; you should
  rarely need to interact with the store directly.

  By default, the store will talk to your backend using a standard REST mechanism.
  You can customize how the store talks to your backend by specifying a custom adapter:

       MyApp.store = DS.Store.create({
         adapter: 'MyApp.CustomAdapter'
       });

  You can learn more about writing a custom adapter by reading the `DS.Adapter`
  documentation.

    This is the main entry point into finding records. The first parameter to
    this method is always a subclass of `DS.Model`.

    You can use the `find` method on a subclass of `DS.Model` directly if your
    application only has one store. For example, instead of
    `store.find(App.Person, 1)`, you could say `App.Person.find(1)`.

    ---

    To find a record by ID, pass the `id` as the second parameter:

        store.find(App.Person, 1);
        App.Person.find(1);

    If the record with that `id` had not previously been loaded, the store will
    return an empty record immediately and ask the adapter to find the data by
    calling the adapter's `find` method.

    The `find` method will always return the same object for a given type and
    `id`. To check whether the adapter has populated a record, you can check
    its `isLoaded` property.

    ---

    To find all records for a type, call `find` with no additional parameters:

        store.find(App.Person);
        App.Person.find();

    This will return a `RecordArray` representing all known records for the
    given type and kick off a request to the adapter's `findAll` method to load
    any additional records for the type.

    The `RecordArray` returned by `find()` is live. If any more records for the
    type are added at a later time through any mechanism, it will automatically
    update to reflect the change.

    ---

    To find a record by a query, call `find` with a hash as the second
    parameter:

        store.find(App.Person, { page: 1 });
        App.Person.find({ page: 1 });

    This will return a `RecordArray` immediately, but it will always be an
    empty `RecordArray` at first. It will call the adapter's `findQuery`
    method, which will populate the `RecordArray` once the server has returned
    results.

    You can check whether a query results `RecordArray` has loaded by checking
    its `isLoaded` property.

    This is separated from acknowledging the record itself
    (via `didSaveRecord`) because a relationship change can
    involve as many as three separate records. Records should
    only move out of the in-flight state once the server has
    acknowledged all of their relationships, and this differs
    based upon the adapter's semantics.

    There are three basic scenarios by which an adapter can
    save a relationship.

    ### Foreign Key

    An adapter can save all relationship changes by updating
    a foreign key on the child record. If it does this, it
    should acknowledge the changes when the child record is
    saved.

        record.eachRelationship(function(name, meta) {
          if (meta.kind === 'belongsTo') {
            store.didUpdateRelationship(record, name);
          }
        });

        store.didSaveRecord(record, data);

    ### Embedded in Parent

    An adapter can save one-to-many relationships by embedding
    IDs (or records) in the parent object. In this case, the
    relationship is not considered acknowledged until both the
    old parent and new parent have acknowledged the change.

    In this case, the adapter should keep track of the old
    parent and new parent, and acknowledge the relationship
    change once both have acknowledged. If one of the two
    sides does not exist (e.g. the new parent does not exist
    because of nulling out the belongs-to relationship),
    the adapter should acknowledge the relationship once
    the other side has acknowledged.

    ### Separate Entity

    An adapter can save relationships as separate entities
    on the server. In this case, they should acknowledge
    the relationship as saved once the server has
    acknowledged the entity.

    @see DS.Store#didSaveRecord

    (for example, if it needs to make multiple HTTP requests to
