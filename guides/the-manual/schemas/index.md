# Schemas

Schemas are how ***Warp*Drive** understands the structure of your data, powering features like caching, relational data, and reactivity.

Schemas are also how [ReactiveResource](/api/@warp-drive/core/reactive/interfaces/ReactiveResource) knows to transform data from its raw serialized form in the cache into richer forms for use by your app.

Schemas are JSON, which ensures a high degree of [flexibility](https://runspired.com/2025/05/25/in-defense-of-machine-formats.html) when creating or loading them.
