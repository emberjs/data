## Inverse

The "inverse" of a relationship is the compound key generated by considering both the related `resource` `type` and the `name` of the matching field on the related `resource`.

E.g. if Users have Pets and Pets have Owners, then the
inverse of the field `user.pets` is `pet.owners`, and the inverse of `pet.owners` is similarly `user.pets`.

`to-none` relationships have no inverse. We often refer to this as a `null inverse`.

## Self Referential

Self referential relationships are relationships that point back at the same resource type.

E.g. if a Person has parents and children, the link between `person.parents` and `person.children` is self-referential because both sides belong to the `person` resource type.

## Reflexive

Reflexive relationships are self-referential relationships that point back at the same property in addition to the same type.

For instance, if a User has friends, where `user.friends`` is its own inverse.

## Circular

A circular relationship is a self-referential or reflexive relationship for which the *value* is the same on both sides.

For instance, if Ego is his own best friend, then `ego.bestFriend === ego`

## Polymorphic

Polymorphic relationsips can be satisfied by multiple resource types. For instance, a user may have many vehicles, and each vehicle might be of type `car` or `boat` or `airplane` etc.
