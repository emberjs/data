# Installation

WarpDrive now provides a cli that will handle installation and configuration for you
when installing the types-packages for native types to use with older releases (such as 4.12).

```cli
npx warp-drive retrofit types@canary
```

The cli will

- uninstall DT packages for ember-source and ember-data
- add native types as sources to your ts-config for both ember-source and ember-data
- install all required types packages for ember-data based on the dependencies in your package.json

The cli may also be used to update to the latest canary versions of the types by
simply running the command again.

For additional documentation or to manuall install and configure, continue reading the
below guide.

> [!CAUTION]
> EmberData does not maintain the DefinitelyTyped types for 
> EmberData (e.g. the `@types/ember-data__*`). If you were
> previously using these, you should uninstall them first.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> EmberData's Native Types require the use of Ember's
> Native Types.
>
> Type definitions need to be installed top-level, this means
> you have to install every EmberData package `ember-data`
> depends on.

> [!TIP]
> When installing packages, use an NPM dist tag to get the latest
> version for a given channel. E.g. `pnpm install ember-data@latest`
> valid channels with types are `latest`, `canary`, `v4-latest` and `v4-canary`

There are currently two ways to gain access to EmberData's native types.

1) [Use A Version That Has Types](#using-native-types)

2) [Use Official Types Packages](#using-types-packages)
with releases `>= 4.12.*`

---

### Using Versions That Supply Types

The following versions supply their own type definitions. These type definitions will still need to be configured for use in tsconfig.

- Versions of 4.x >= 4.13.0-alpha.0
- Versions of 5.x >= 5.3.8

In order to use the types for these versions, the dependencies of `ember-data` (and their peer-dependencies) must also be added to `package.json`.

Generally that means the following packages are needed, though you may need fewer (or more!) depending on if you have migrated away from Adapter/Serializer and replaced Model with SchemaRecord:

> [!TIP]
> If your package manager enables deduping, we recommend deduping types as much as possible.

>[!TIP]
> It is best to ensure no other dependencies are still bringing `@types/*` packages as this will cause weird type bugs.

### Using Types Packages

> [!WARNING]
> When consuming types in this way, you may sometimes
> encounter a misalignment between the types and the actual API. These misalignments should be rare for 4.12.* => 5.4.*. Overall, even when these misalignments occur, we suspect there are fewer mistakes or issues with these types than in the DefinitelyTyped types.


Every package in the project that ships types also publishes its types under a second package name.
This enables older releases to consume these types instead of relying on the DefinitelyTyped project.

These types-only packages have the same version number as the version they were published with, and their org or name is suffixed with `-types`.
