# Configuration

There are currently two ways to gain access to EmberData's native types.
Follow the configuration guide below for the [installation](./0-installation.md)
option you chose.

1) [Use Canary](#using-canary)

2) [Use Official Types Packages](#using-types-packages)
with releases `>= 4.12.*`


> [!CAUTION]
> EmberData does not maintain the DefinitelyTyped types for 
> EmberData (e.g. the `@types/ember-data__*`). If you were
> previously using these, you should uninstall them first.
