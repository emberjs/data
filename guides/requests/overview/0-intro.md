## What Is a Request?

A request is the process of fetching data from a source or asking a
 source to update data to a new state. Sources can be anything that
 has the ability for you to store and retrieve data, for example your
API or IndexedDB.

Though the actual source and transport do not matter, in a typical app requests are handled by [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

Irrespective of source or transport, it still helps to conceptualize requests as a formalization of fetch [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
/ [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) 
lifecycles, and for convenience we adopt those APIs.
