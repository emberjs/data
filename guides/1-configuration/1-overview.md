::: tip EmberData/WarpDrive Packages Have Been [Simplified](https://rfcs.emberjs.com/id/1075-warp-drive-package-unification/)

Looking for the [Old Package Setup Guide?](./4-old-package-setup/1-overview.md)
:::

# Configuration

***Warp*Drive** is highly configurable. The library is designed as a series of small packages and primitives with clear interface-driven boundaries between each other and brought together
by configuration.

Below, we detail the installation for the most common configurations.

## Installation {#installation}

::: info üí° TIP
WarpDrive uses npm channel tags to simplify installation. Available channels include:
- `@lts` | `@latest` | `@beta` | `@canary`

Replace `@latest` in the commands below with a different channel as desired.
:::

::: code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add -E @warp-drive/core@latest @warp-drive/json-api@latest
```

```sh [npm]
npm add -E @warp-drive/core@latest @warp-drive/json-api@latest
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add -E @warp-drive/core@latest @warp-drive/json-api@latest
```

```sh [bun]
bun add --exact @warp-drive/core@latest @warp-drive/json-api@latest
```

### Lockstep Versioning

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
WarpDrive packages follow lockstep: dependencies and peer-dependencies between WarpDrive packages are version-locked at the time of publish.

We find this means its best to use exact versions instead of ranges as all WarpDrive packages should be upgraded together at once.

All of the installation commands listed in this guide pin the version for this reason.
:::

## Other Packages

Install `@warp-drive/utilities` for commonly needed request builder, handler and string utils.

Install `@warp-drive/experiments` for bleeding edge unstable features
we're prototyping like SharedWorker and PersistedCache.

::: code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add -E @warp-drive/experiments@latest
