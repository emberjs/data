```ts
const result = await store.request({
  url: '/api/users?search=Chris'
})
```

```glimmer-ts
const UsersSearch = {
  url: '/api/users?search=Chris'
};

export default <template>
  <Request @query={{UsersSearch}}>
    <:content as |result|>
      <ul>
        {{#each result.data as |user|}}
          <li>{{user.name}}</li>
        {{/each}}
      </ul>
    </:content>
  </Request>
</template>
```

Every request three distinct parts

- *the request* - the object we construct to describe what it is we want to do
- *fulfillment* - how we go about making the request do the thing we need it to do
- *the response* - the processed result once the request is complete

### Fetch Example

> [!TIP]
> When we want to show integration with a framework, this tutorial
> uses [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com), a powerful modern web framework with an established multi-decade legacy.

<br>

*Run This Example* â†’ [Request | Fetch Example](https://warpdrive.nullvoxpopuli.com/manual/requests/fetch)

<br>

Data fetching is managed by a `RequestManager`, which executes handlers you provide.

In order to make requests, first we create a `RequestManager` for our
application, and we tell it to fulfill requests using a `Fetch` handler.

```ts
import RequestManager from '@ember-data/request';
import { Fetch } from '@ember-data/request/fetch';

const manager = new RequestManager().use([Fetch]);
```

Now we can issue a request for a list of our users:

```ts
const { content } = await manager.request({ url: '/users' });

for (const user of content.data) {
  greet(`${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`);
}
```

If we wanted to type the above request, we could supply a type for the
content returned by the request:

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
};

type UsersQuery = {
  data: User[];
}
```

And use it like this:

```ts
const { content } = await manager.request<UsersQuery>({ url: '/users' });
```

> [!TIP]
> Manually supplying the generic is NOT the preferred way
> to type a request, look for the section on [builders](./7-builders.md)
> later.

<br>

### The Chain of Responsibility

When we created the request manager for our application above, you may have noticed that when we told it to fulfill requests using the `Fetch` handler we did so by passing in an array:

```ts
new RequestManager().use([Fetch]);
```

The request manager follows the [chain-of-responsibility pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern): each handler in our array may choose to fulfill the request, modify it, or pass it along unchanged to the next handler in the array, in array order.

    C(Handler 1)
    C <==> D(Handler 2)
    D <==> E(Handler 3)
    C <--> F@{ shape: lin-cyl, label: "Source A" }
    D <--> G@{ shape: lin-cyl, label: "Source B" }
    E <--> H@{ shape: lin-cyl, label: "Source C" }
```


A handler receives the request `context` as well as a `next` function with which to pass along
a request if it so chooses.

```ts
type NextFn<T> = (req: RequestInfo) => Future<T>;

type Handler = {
  request<T>(context: RequestContext, next: NextFn<T>): Promise<T> | Future<T>;
}
```

`next` returns a Future, which is a promise with a few additional capabilities. Futures resolve
with the response from the next handler in the chain. This allows a handler to read or modify
the response if it wants.

> [!Important]
> requests are immutable, to modify one the handler must create a new request, copying over or
> cloning the parts it wants to leave unchanged.

```ts
type NextFn<T> = (req: RequestInfo) => Future<T>;

type Handler = {
  request<T>(context: RequestContext, next: NextFn<T>): Promise<T> | Future<T>;
}
```

A handler may be any object with a `request` method. This allows both stateful and non-stateful handlers to be utilized.

> [!TIP]
> Handlers should take care of the most generalizable concerns. In general great handlers
> - apply to many-if-not-all requests
> - have a clear heuristic by which they activate (a header, op-code, option, or url scheme)
> - don't block response streaming (we'll talk about this later)
