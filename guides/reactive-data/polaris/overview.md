🚧 This guide is under active construction, it will talk about the below points 🚧 

In PolarisMode records are:

- immutable (unless creating or checking out for editing)
- local changes only show where you want them to on the editable version
- none of the APIs of Model (references, state props, currentState, methods etc)
- deep reactivity for fields
- advanced derivations, aliasing and transformations
- [currently] limited support for relationships
- no promise proxies for relationships
