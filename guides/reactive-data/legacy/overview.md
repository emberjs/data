# LegacyMode

- ⮐ [ReactiveData](../index.md)

---

🚧 This guide is under active construction, it will talk about the below points 🚧 

In LegacyMode records are:

- mutable
- local changes immediately reflect app wide
- all the APIs of Model (references, state props, currentState, methods etc)
- limited reactivity for fields (same as Model)
- requires continued use of the `model` and `legacy-compat` packages (though most imports from them can be removed)
