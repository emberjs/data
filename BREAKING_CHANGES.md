# BREAKING CHANGES

This file lists breaking changes, ordered by revision number.

When you instantiate your adapter, include the API revision number, and
ember-data will automatically warn you of any breaking changes.

The ember-data project follows [semver](http://semver.org/) versioning.
Because we have not yet reached 1.0, breaking changes are allowed, but
we want to make sure that you are alerted to intentional breaking
changes.

Once we reach 1.0, we will remove this mechanism and use normal version
numbers to indicate breaking changes.

Example:

```javascript
App.Store = DS.Store.create({
  revision: 1
});
```

If a breaking change has been made to API revision 1, you will receive
an exception pointing you to this document. Once you have reviewed the
breaking changes and made any necessary changes to your application, you
will want to update the revision:

```javascript
App.Store = DS.Store.create({
  revision: 2
});
```

This will remove the exception about changes before revision 2. You will
receive another warning if there is another change.

## Revision 1

### Filter Functions

Previously, the store's `filter()` method took a filtering function that
passed the hash in directly. It now passes a proxy object that
implements a `get()` method.

Instead of accessing properties of the hash directly, please use `get()`
inside your filter functions:

```javascript
// instead of
var coolPeople = Person.filter(function(person) {
  return person.name.test(/Tom/);
});

// do
var coolPeople = Person.filter(function(person) {
  return person.get('name').test(/Tom/);
});
```

### Retrieving JSON Representation in Adapters

Previously, a record's `data` property was a hash that contained the
JSON representation of the record that should be sent to your
persistence layer. Now that records store uncommitted changes in a
separate hash, you should use the new `toJSON()` method to retrieve the
data hash to be sent to the server.

We could have fixed up the `data` property to return the JSON
representation, and used a different property internally, but didn't
because:

* Compatibility with ES5's JSON serialization protocol required the
  implementation of a `toJSON` method.
* Before 1.0, we want to remove unnecessary cruft from the library.
  Since we need `toJSON` anyway for ES5 compatibility, we didn't want to
  keep around a legacy mechanism for doing the same thing.

(post 1.0, we absolutely would have left around the `data` hash)

```javascript
// instead of
$.ajax({
  data: record.get('data')
});

// do
$.ajax({
  data: record.toJSON()
});
```
