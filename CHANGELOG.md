# Ember Data Changelog

### Master

### Ember Data 1.0.0-beta.8 _(May 28, 2014)_

* Each RecordArray gets a copy of the models's metada object instead of sharing the same meta object. Enables several paginated arrays to coexist without clobbering each other
* Drop the `type` argument from `normalizePayload` calls. This argument was not consistently passed. Overridding the `extract` functions on the serializer is a suggested alternative if you require the model type.
* Introduce `DS._setupContainer()` for use in testing
* Deprecate the 5 Ember initializers, use just one named "ember-data"
* DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin methods for serializing relationships call super if needed
* moved normalizeId to JSONSerializer
* JSONSerializer should use the attrs hash when extracting records Also breaks the _super chain in normalize to preserve ordering in the RESTSerializer
* Remove unnessary loop in extracting single using DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin
* Do not presume returned data arrays support .pushObjects
* [BUGFIX] store.fetchMany should always return a promise.
* Use keyForRelationship in JSONSerializer's serializeHasMany method
