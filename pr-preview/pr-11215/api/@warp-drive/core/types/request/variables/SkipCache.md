  bypass the CacheHandler so it neither resolves from nor updates the cache.

# &#x20;SkipCache

```ts
const SkipCache: "___(unique) Symbol(SkipCache)";
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/request.ts:36](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/b2f9730e03048c8b1233b4af3382b707898c8f15/warp-drive-packages/core/src/types/request.ts#L36)

A [cacheOptions](../types/RequestInfo.md#cacheoptions) flag which, when set,
signals that a request should never be handled by the cache-manager and
thus will never resolve from cache nor update the cache.
