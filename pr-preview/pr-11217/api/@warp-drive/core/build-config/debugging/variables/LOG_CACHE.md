  replaces `LOG_PAYLOADS`, `LOG_OPERATIONS`, and `LOG_MUTATIONS`.

# &#x20;LOG\_CACHE&#x20;

```ts
const LOG_CACHE: boolean;
```

Defined in: [warp-drive-packages/build-config/src/debugging.ts:25](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/e75fe00c15999baf9e36ef9be92910cb9906dc62/warp-drive-packages/build-config/src/debugging.ts#L25)

log cache updates for both local
and remote state. Note in some older versions
this was called `LOG_PAYLOADS` and was one
of three flags that controlled logging of
cache updates. This is now the only flag.

The others were `LOG_OPERATIONS` and `LOG_MUTATIONS`.
