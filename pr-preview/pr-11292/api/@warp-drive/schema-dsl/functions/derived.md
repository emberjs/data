```

Defined in: [fields/derived.ts:61](https://github.com/warp-drive-data/warp-drive/blob/5127bc5b162f2ebe5d9578e3204f3e955b63c5f8/warp-drive-packages/schema-dsl/src/fields/derived.ts#L61)

cache and are never sent to the server.

## Parameters

### options

[`DerivedOptions`](../types/DerivedOptions.md)

## Returns

(`target`: `object`, `key`: `string`) => `void`

## Example

::: code-group

```ts [user.ts]
import { Resource, field, derived } from '@warp-drive/schema-dsl';

@Resource
export class User {
  @field declare firstName: string;
  @field declare lastName: string;
  @derived({ type: '@concat' }) declare displayName: string;
}
```

```json [compiled fields (excerpt)]
[
  { "kind": "derived", "name": "displayName", "type": "@concat" }
]
```
