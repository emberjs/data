## Ember Data [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/emberjs/data.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/emberjs/data)

Ember Data is a library for robustly managing model data in your
Ember.js applications.

Ember Data is designed to be agnostic to the underlying persistence
mechanism, so it works just as well with JSON APIs over HTTP as it does
with streaming WebSockets or local IndexedDB storage.

It provides many of the facilities you'd find in server-side ORMs like
ActiveRecord, but is designed specifically for the unique environment of
JavaScript in the browser.

In particular, Ember Data uses Promises/A+-compatible promises from the
ground up to manage loading and saving records, so integrating with
other JavaScript APIs is easy.

## Using Ember Data

### Getting Ember Data

```no-highlight
bower install ember-data --save
```

The latest passing build from the "master" branch is available on
[http://emberjs.com/builds/#/canary](http://emberjs.com/builds/#/canary).

Similarly, the latest passing build from the "beta" branch can be found
on [http://emberjs.com/builds/#/beta](http://emberjs.com/builds/#/beta)

Or build ember-data.js yourself. Clone the repository and run `npm run dist`
after [setup](#setup). You'll find ember-data.js in the `dist` directory.

#### Internet Explorer 8

If you need to support Internet Explorer, you will need to use es5-shim.js and
es5-sham.js from [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim).

### Instantiating the Store

In Ember Data, the _store_ is responsible for managing the lifecycle of
your models. Every time you need a model or a collection of models,
you'll ask the store for it.

To create a store, you don't need to do anything. Just by loading the
Ember Data library, all of the routes and controllers in your
application will get a new `store` property. This property is an
instance of `DS.Store` that will be shared across all of the routes and
controllers in your app.

### Defining Your Models

First thing's first: tell Ember Data about the models in your
application. For example, imagine we're writing a blog reader app.
Here's what your model definition would look like if you're using
globals (that is, not something like Ember App Kit or ember-cli):

```js
var attr = DS.attr;
var hasMany = DS.hasMany;
var belongsTo = DS.belongsTo;

App.BlogPost = DS.Model.extend({
  title: attr(),
  createdAt: attr('date'),

  comments: hasMany('comment')
});

App.Comment = DS.Model.extend({
  body: attr(),
  username: attr(),

  post: belongsTo('blogPost')
});
```

If you're using ES6 modules (via Ember App Kit or ember-cli), your
models would look like this:

```js
// app/models/blog-post.js
var attr = DS.attr;
var hasMany = DS.hasMany;

export default DS.Model.extend({
  title: attr(),
  createdAt: attr('date'),

  comments: hasMany('comment')
});

// app/models/comment.js
var attr = DS.attr;
var belongsTo = DS.belongsTo;

export default DS.Model.extend({
  body: attr(),
  username: attr(),

  post: belongsTo('blogPost')
});
```

### A Brief Note on Adapters

Without immediately diving in to the depths of the architecture, one
thing you _should_ know is that Ember Data uses an object called an
_adapter_ to know how to talk to your server.

An adapter is just an object that knows how to translate requests from
Ember Data into requests on your server. For example, if I ask the Ember
Data store for a record of type `person` with an ID of `123`, the
adapter translates that into an XHR request to (for example)
`api.example.com/v3/person/123.json`.

By default, Ember Data will use the `RESTAdapter`, which adheres to a
set of RESTful JSON conventions.

Ember Data also ships with the `FixtureAdapter`, useful for testing and
prototyping before you have a server, and the `ActiveModelAdapter`,
which is designed to work out-of-the-box with the
[`ActiveModel::Serializers`](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers)
gem for Rails.

To learn more about adapters, including what conventions the
`RESTAdapter` follows and how to build your own, see the Ember.js
Guides: [Connecting to an HTTP
Server](http://emberjs.com/guides/models/connecting-to-an-http-server/).

### Fetching a Collection of Models

From your route or controller:

```js
this.store.find('blogPost');
```

This returns a promise that resolves to the collection of records.

### Fetching a Single Model

```js
this.store.find('blogPost', 123);
```

This returns a promise that resolves to the requested record. If the
record can't be found or there was an error during the request, the
promise will be rejected.

### Even More Documentation

on models](http://emberjs.com/guides/models/).

## API Stability

Ember Data is still under active development and is currently beta
quality. That being said, the API has largely stabilized and many
companies are using it in production.

For details on anticipated changes before the 1.0 release, see the blog
post [The Road to Ember Data
1.0](http://emberjs.com/blog/2014/03/18/the-road-to-ember-data-1-0.html).

# Building Ember Data

1. Ensure that [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is installed.
2. Run `npm install` to ensure the required dependencies are installed.
3. Run `npm run dist` to build Ember Data. The builds will be placed in the `dist/` directory.
